        <p>If he leaves a \\(5\\), he needs two \\(1\\)s, which is a \\(\\frac{1}{6}^2=\\frac{1}{36}\\) chance, which is lower than \\(\\frac{5}{72}\\)</p>
        <p>If he leaves a \\(4\\), he must get a \\(2\\) and a \\(1\\). There are \\(2 \\cdot 1\\) ways for this to happen for a total probability of \\(\\frac{2}{36}\\), still not enough</p>
        <p>For \\(3\\), we can have \\(3, 1\\) or \\(2, 2\\) which gives a \\(\\frac{3}{36}\\) chance. This is enough</p>
        <p>Next is \\(2\\) which can give \\(4, 1\\) or \\(3, 2,\\) for a total probability of \\(\\frac{4}{36}\\). Also enough</p>
        <p>Finally, we have \\(1\\) which gives \\(1,5\\), \\(4,2\\) or \\(3,3\\) for \\(\\frac{5}{36}\\) </p>

She does not hop diagonally. When the direction of a hop would take Frieda off the grid, she "wraps around" and jumps to the opposite edge.
        For example if Frieda begins in the center square and makes two hops "up", the first hop would place her in the top row middle square, and the second hop would cause Frieda to jump to the opposite edge, landing in the bottom row
        middle square. Suppose Frieda starts from the center square, makes at most four hops at random, and stops hopping if she lands on a corner square. What is the probability that she reaches a corner square on one of the four hops?`,

        text: `There are three jars. Each of three coins is placed in one of the three jars, chosen at random and independently of the placements of the other coins. What is the expected number of coins in a jar with the most coins?`,
        solution: `<b>\\(\\frac{17}{9}\\)</b><p>We calculate the probabiity of the higher jar having \\(x\\) number of coins</p>
        <p>Case 1: All 3. There are \\(3\\) choose \\(1\\) = \\(3\\) ways to pick which jar, and a \\(\\frac{1}{3}^3=\\frac{1}{27}\\) chance of them all ending up there. We have \\(\\frac{3}{27}  \\cdot 3 =\\frac{1}{3}\\), which we multiply by \\(3\\) because it's expected outcome</p>
        <p>Case 2: We have \\(3\\) choose \\(2=3\\) ways to pick which has \\(2\\), and \\(2\\) choose \\(1=2\\) ways to pick which has \\(1\\). There are \\(3\\) choose \\(2=3\\) ways to pick which coins are in the most, so we have \\(3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 18\\) and then \\(\\frac{18}{27} \\cdot 2= \\frac{4}{3}\\)</p>
        <p>Case 3: They each have \\(1\\). There are \\(3!=6\\) ways for this to happen. We have \\(\\frac{6}{27}=\\frac{2}{9}\\).</p>
        <p>Adding these gives \\(\\frac{1}{3} +\\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{2}{9}=\\frac{17}{9}\\)</p>`,

        text: `A point \\(P\\) is chosen at random inside square \\(ABCD\\). The probability that \\(\\overline{AP}\\) is neither the shortest nor the longest side of \\(\\triangle APB\\) can be written as 
        \\(\\frac{a+b\\pi -c\\sqrt{d}}{e}\\, where \\(a,b,c,d\\) and \\(e\\\) are positive integers, \\(\\textup{gcd}(a,b,c,e)=1\\), and \\(d\\) is not divisible by the square of a prime. What is \\(a+b+c+d+e\\)? `,
        solution: `<b>25</b>Let's just assume that the height of the square is \\(1\\) and that \\(AB\\) is the top. The solution will work whatever you do, but this is forced simplification. Since we're dealing with probability instead of
        concrete area,we use whatever is simplest in a technique called "forced simplification".</p>
        <p>We can either have \\(AB>AP>BP\\) or \\(BP>AP>AB\\), so we'll do some casework based on that</p>
        <p>We divide the square in half vertically. For all points on the left, we have \\(AP < AB\\) and for all values on the right we have \\(AP>AB\\) (on the line gives \\(AP=AB\\) but that doesn't matter too much)
        Drawing a quarter arc of radius \\(1\\) centered around \\(A\\) gives us an area bounded such that inside \\(AP < AB\\)</p>
        <p> For our first case, \\(AB>AP>BP\\), we need to be inside the circle on the right. We draw a line from \\(A\\) to where the arc intercepts the line. This has length \\(1\\) and makes a \\(60\\) degree angle with \\(AB\\) (because the distance from \\(AD\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and the length is \\(1\\) so we figure through trig). 
        The area of the slice is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\). We subtract the area of the triangular part bounded by the line we drew, the vertical line, and half of \\(AB\\) which is \\(\\\\sqrt{3}{8}\\) (find the side lengths through pythag theorem. The total area of this space is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}-\\sqrt{3}{8}\\)</p>
        <p>For our second case, we're looking outside the arc but on the left of the line. For this, we'll find the area of the wedge made by the arc, \\(AD\\) and the line to the intersection, the area of the triangle (we found it before to be \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\)), and subtract it from \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). The arc has an area of \\(\\frac{pi}{12}\\)so we have an area 
        of \\(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{\\pi}{12}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\)</p>
        <p>We have the probability to be \\(\\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{6}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8}+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{\\pi}{12}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8}}{1}\\) which we simplify down to
        \\(\\frac{6+\\pi-3\\sqrt{3}}{12}\\) for \\(6+1+3+3+12=25\\)</p>
