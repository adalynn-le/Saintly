        answer: "32pi",
        difficulty: 2,
        solution: `<b>\\(32\\pi\\)</b><p>The key tip of this problem is to make everything as simple as possible. We have virtually no constraints for the size of the smaller semicircle. Thus, we can manipulate it however we want. For us, the simplest solution is to ignore it by making it infitesimally small to the point where it is no longer consequential. The smaller the circle gets, the closer \\(\\overline{CD}\\) or \\(16\\) gets to the diameter. Thus, if we ignore the existence of the semicircle, the diameter becomes 16. It is easy to solve from there, because we're just finding the area of a semicircle with diameter \\(16\\).

        solution: `<b>0.75</b><p>Since we're only dealing with ratios, we can make the dimension of the larger square whatever we want. If this weren't abour ratios, I would recommend using a variable. However, since the values don't really matter here, we can just use 1, which will make our math the easiest. The areas of the squares are then 1, \\(k^2\\) (since the side lengths are multiplied by k, and then multiplied by each other). Effectively from here on out, the area is \\(k\\) raised to the power of the-xth-largest-square-times-two.

        <p> This is an infinite geometric series. The sum of these is \\(\\frac{a}{1-r}\\) (see alebra page), where \\(a\\) is the first item and \\(r\\) is the common ratio. The geometric series we are dealing with has 1 as a first item and \\(-k^2\\) as a common ratio. Plug this in to get a sum of \\(\\frac{1}{1+k^2}\\)
        Since we know that the area of the first square is 1, we don't have to divide: this is our common ratio, or \\(\\frac{64}{100}\\). Using this, we can solve for \\(k\\)</p>

        <p>From here, we can use the fact that two triangles are similar to set up two ratios.

        solution: `<b>12</b><p>Let's start by setting a few clear rules nad guidelines, then we'll procede to use casework:</p>
        <p>First, we know that two reflections over the same axis will return \\(T\\) to the original position. This can't happen, because that would mean we only have on turn left, which would take it back off the origin</p>
        <p>The same can be said about two rotations of \\(180^\\circ\\).</p>
        <p>If we use ONLY rotations, we know that the sum of the angles of the rotations must be some multiple of \\(360\\). This can only occur in \\(2\\) ways (discounting order), being \\(90, 90, 180\\) and \\(270, 270, 180\\). We can confirm this
        with some modular arithmetic, but I won't get into that. Since two of the tranformations are the same, there are only \\(3\\) ways to order them, so there are \\(6\\) ways to get \\(T\\) back to the ORIGIN using ONLY rotations.</p>
        <p>Next, let's consider a situation where we use \\(1\\) reflection</p>
        <p>Some quick casework shows that this is impossible, since you can't isolate and get the one variable that you make negative back to being positive without switching them and switching back, which would then get the other variable negative.</p>
        <p>Now, we use \\(2\\) transformations. We've already proved that they can't be of the same type, so we have one reflection over the \\(x\\) axis and one over the \\(y\\) axis. This leaves us with \\((-x,-y)\\), which we can get back to \\((x,y)\\) by a rotation of 
        \\(180^\\circ\\). With \\(3\\) distinct transformations, we can order it in \\(3!=6\\) ways. Thus, there are \\(6+6=12\\) solutions.`,

        <p>This took me a while to fully understand, but essentially, we're finding the volume of a shape where the boundaries are all \\(r\\) units away from the edges and faces of \\(B\\). If you want to draw this out, it looks like a rounded rectangular prism</p>

        bae and side of the cone. What is \\(r\\)?`,
        solution: `<b>\\(\\frac{90=40\\sqrt{3}}{11}\\)</b><p>First start by drawing two diagrams. The first is half a vertical cross-section of the cone. We would draw a right triangle with legs \\(5\\) and \\(12\\) and hypotenuse(by pythagorean theorem\\) \\(13\\). We then draw a circle of radius \\(r\\) tangent to the bottom 
        leg and to the hypotenuse. We note that it is NOT tangent to the longer leg, because in order for that to be true, all \\(3\\) spheres would have to touch the middle of the cone, which isn't possible</p>
        <p>The next is a circle that is essentially the bottom cross-section. A circle of radius \\(5\\) with three circles inside. Note that these circles aren't tangent to the large circle, because then they would have to be tangent to the edge of the cone, where the pointy bit and the base meet, which obviously is not possible.</p>
        <p>Like a good deal of diagrams on the AMC 10, these weren't nescessarily nescessary for the problem itself, but conceptualizing it, at least to me, makes it infinitely easier.</p>
        <p>Returning back to the second drawing, let's draw lines between the centers of all the small circles, the ones with radius \\(r\\). This yields an equilateral triangle. We know that the center of the circle of radius \\(5\\) is also the circumcenter, incenter, and centroid of the triangle.</p>
        <p>Let's focus in on that last one, centroid. A centroid is the intersection of all medians and divides the medians into two parts witha \\(2:1\\) ratio. Let's focus on the vertical centroid, or at least the one that appears vertical. If you don't have one of these in our drawing, you can always rotate it. We know that the length of this median is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) because \\(1^2+b^2=2^2\\) (pythagorean theorem), so
        the sides on opposite sides of the centroid have lengths of \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\), respectively. Hold on to this, we'll come back later.</p>
        <p>Let's return back to our first drawing. We know that there is some distance between the circle and the center of the cone. We don't exactly know what that is, because we don't know the radius of the circle. We do, however, from our last diagram, know the distance between the 
        center of that circle and the center of the larger circle: \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).</p>
        <p>We can also draw a radius from the center of the circle to the center of the cone. This divides the height of the cone into \\(12-r\\) and \\(r\\), since the bottom bit has the lenght of the radius. If we draw a line from the top of the cone to the center of the circle, that forms a right triangle with legs of, guess what, \\(12-r\\) and \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\). The hypotenuse, in addition to being
        the sum of those two squared, is ALSO the hypotenuse of a triangle formed by drawing a radius from the center to the point where the circle is tangent to the cone. This has a leg of \\(r\\), the radius and \\(13-(5-\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}=8+\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\), which we derive  because the remaining length of the base, on the opposite side of the center of the sphere, is the same length as the remaining part of the \\(13\\) hypotenuse, by power of a 
        point.</p>
        <p>Set the two equations equal to eachother and solve:</p>
        $$

        larger square as shown. The sum of all possible values of the area of \\(R\\) can be written in the form \\(frac{m}{n}\\), where \\(m\\) 
        and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers. What is \\(m+n\\?)`,
        solution: `<b>67</b><p>Draw a square that inscribes the square of side length \\(1\\) and cuts the isoceles triangle between the large square, the small square, and the rectangle with defined points into two parts. We
        know that this triangle is isoceles because it has two side lengths of \\(1\\).</p>
        <p>This creates \\(6\\) congruent triangles by \\(AAS\\). We can label the legs of the triangle \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) for short and long, respectively.</p>
        <p>We also see a congruent triangle bounded in the right bottom corner by the larger rectangle. We can label that too.</p>
        <p>We also know that, by \\(AA\\), the triangle with hypotenuse \\(3\\) in the bottom left corner is similar to these with a ratio of \\(1:3\\) (since the hypotenuse of the congruent ones is \\(1\\) and the hypotenuse of the bigger one is \\(3\\)). We can then label
        accordingly, so the legs are \\(3a\\) and \\(3b\\). Since the larger shape, the one that contains all of these, is a square, we know the side lengths must be equal, so \\(a+b+b+3a=3b+a\\) or\\(3a=b\\). Rename every instance of \\(b\\) with this, for simplicity.</p>
        <p>We can find the exact value of \\(a\\) using the pythagorean theorem beacause \\(a^2+9a^2=1\\), which means \\(10a^2=1\\) and thus \\(a=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}\\).</p>
        <p>By drawing a horizontal line through the intersection of \\(R\\) and the oter rectangle to the side of the larger square, we can create another right triangle. We know that this triangle is similar to the \\(6\\) or \\(7\\) congruent triangles. We can
        call the side lengths of these \\(x\\) and \\(3x\\). The side length of a the large square is \\(10a\\). We know that the triangle formed between the square we drew and rectangle \\(R\\) are congruent by \\(AAS\\). Thus, we can call one side of the triangle \\(3a\\) and another \\(3x\\) (because it is the same as the one we mentioned before)</p>
        <p>Since we know that the side lengths sum to \\(10a\\), we can label the remaining sides as \\(6a-3x\\) and \\(4a-x\\). By \\(AA\\), the triangle that those lengths form is similar to the one below it, with side lengths \\(3a\\) and \\(3x\\).</p>
        <p>We set up te ratio \\(\\frac{3x}{3x}=\\frac{6a-3x}{4a-x}\\), which we can multiply out to be \\(12a^2-3ax=18ax-9x\\) which we can divide by \\(3\\) into \\(4a^2-ax-3x^2\\) and factor into \\((4a-3x)(a-x)\\).</p>
        <p>We have two solutions for where \\(a=c\\) and \\(a=\\frac{3}{4}\\). We try both of these situations seperately</p>
        <p>Calculating from here gets messy. However, we can solve for the possible side lengths using \\(a=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10}}\\) in both cases to find areas of \\(\\frac{9}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\) for \\(\\frac{m}{n}=\\frac{52}{15}\\) and \\(m+n=67\\)</p>

      solution: `<b>\\(\\sqrt{5}-1\\)</b><p>When we fold a pentagon, or any regular polygon, so that it forms another regular polygon of the same sort, we notice two things:</p>
      <p>1) The inner polygon is rotated (idk this helped me visualize it)</p>
