        solution: `<b>3</b>You can start by either factoring or just outright solving. From what I've found, the latter is more common, although for this example I will factor to keep things cleaner.

        f(x)=(100-100a)(-a-1)(a)

        solution: `<b> -120 </b> <p>Pure intuition tells is that \\(10!\\) is going to be less than \\(7! \\cdot 6!\\), but let's expand that further.</p>

        <p>\\(10\\) is \\(5 \\cdot 2 \\), which we can find in \\(6!\\) </p>
        <p> With the numbers we have left, we can't get \\(9\\) or \\(8\\), but we can we can confidently say that the remaining product is greater than \\(6!\\). This means that \\(10!\\) is less than \\(7! \\cdot 6!\\), meaning that the answer would be negative. Since there is only one negative answer, the answer must be -120. </p>
        <p> On the AMC 10, it is not always the best option to compute everything. Due to the time constraint, if you see an answer that is different, or if you have a strong intuition, it could be strategic to go with that. </p>

        <p> Since \\(a^2+b^2\\) should be as small as possible in order for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be as small as possible, and we already know that a+b = 13, the expression ends up </p>

A target \\(T\\) is the region where \\((x^2+y^2-25)^2 \\le 49\\). A dart is thrown and lands at a random point in \\(B\\). The probability that the dart lands in \\(T\\) can be expressed as \\(frac{m}{n} \\cdot \\pi \\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers. What is \\(m+n\\)?
        `,
        type: "mc",
        choices: ["\\(A) 39\\)", "\\(B) 71\\)", "\\(C) 73\\)", "\\(D) 75\\)", "\\(E) 135\\)"],
        answer: "\\(B) 71\\)",
        solution: `<b>71</b> <p>The first step is to visualize the graph. If you are particularly knowledgeable about different types of graphs and functions, you may know that \\(|x|+|y| \\le 8\\) maps out a diamond-like shape. However, let's go through through why this is true: </p>
        <p>Consider the definition of absolute value   functions, and the root absolute value function. It is pretty common knowledge that \\(y=|x|\\) looks sort of like a V. This is because absolute value, by definition, makes everything positive. When looking at the equation \\(|x|+|y|\\) we know that there are four different situations, \\(2\\) where \\(x\\) is positive and \\(2\\) where \\(x\\) is negative, with the same being true for y. Thus, this means that 4 potential linear graphs are created, which are bounded and converge to make a diamond. We know that the "vertices" are at every point on an axis that has an absolute value of \\(8\\), since that is the y/x intercept.</p>
        <p>To find the probability that the dart lands in the target, excluding human error (you probably won't have to worry about this in a math competition), we just find the area of the target and divide it by the area of the square. First, let's find the area of the square.
        <p>Use the pythagorean theorem to find the side lengths of the square </p>
        $$
        \\sqrt{8^2+8^2}
        $$
        $$
        \\sqrt{128}
        $$
        <p>Since the area of a square is just the side length squared, we know that the area of the square is \\(128\\).

        <p>Notice that this is squared. The most important thing about squares is that it makes everything positive. Since \\(49\\) is a perfect square, we can take that as a hint to take the square root of the equation. This gives us
        $$
        |x^2+y^2-25| \\le 7
        $$
        <p>We use absolute value because the value can be equal to \\(\\pm 7\\)</p>
        <p>We can rewrite this equation into a compound inequality:</p>
        $$
        -7 \\le x^2+y^2-25 \\le 7
        $$
        $$
        18 \\le x^2+y^2 \\le 32
        $$
        <p>Returning to the formula of a circle, \\(x^2+y^2=r^2\\). If we treat the less than equal to as an equal sign, we can see that the area bounded is between two circles of radiuses \\(\\sqrt{18}) and \\(\\sqrt{32})
        $$
        <p>The target is bounded between these circles, so we just need to find the area of the larger circle and subtract the area of the smaller cirlce. Obviously, the larger circle has a radius \\(sqrt{32}\\)</p>
        $$
        \\sqrt{32}^2\\pi
        $$
        <p>which is \\(32\\pi\\)</p>
        <p>Now find the smaller circle (gonna skip the math because it's self-explanatory) which should be \\(18\\pi\\).</p>
        <p>Subtracting gives a target of area \\(14\\pi\\)</p>
        <p>This means the probability of hitting the target is \\(\\frac{14\\pi}{128}\\), which simplifies into \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{64}\\) making \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) \\(7\\) and \\(64\\), respectively. Add these to get a sum of \\(71\\).</p>
        <h3>Common Mistake❗❗❗</h3>
        <p>While you don't have to, and really shouldn't, try to graph out every point on coordinate grid, it definitely helps to have a sketch and get an idea of what you are solving for. Also, both of the equations were some sort of way of building on common functions/equations. Make sure you know your basics so that you can expand further!</p>`,

        <p>A) all the terms being added are integers</p>
        <p>B) the non-integer terms sum to an integer</p>
        <p>\\(P(2022)\\) and \\(P(2024)\\) must be integers they are divisble by \\(2\\). Even if they weren't divislbe by larger powers of \\(2\\), the equation conveniently raises these numbers to specific powers in order to change it into a number that is divisble by \\(4\\), \\(8\\), etc. </p>
        <p>Now lets look at the remaining numbers, \\(2023\\) and \\(2025\\). Neither of these numbers are divisble by \\(2\\), so they will produce a decimal part for all terms of this equation. That being said, if those decimal parts can sum to an integer, than the sum will still be an integer.</p>
        <p>For both \\(2023\\) and \\(2025\\), we know that the remainder when divided by \\(2\\) will be \\(0.5\\). Recalling the divisibility rules for powers of \\(2\\), we know that when a number is divided by \\(2\\) to the  \\(n\\)th power, if the last \\(n\\) digits are divisible by \\(2\\) to the \\(n\\)th power, so is the original number.</p>
        <p>Since we want to save time, instead of calculating \\(2023^2\\), we calculate \\(23^2\\) and find the last two digits, since we know they will be the same in both cases. This ends up being \\(529\\), with the last two digits being \\(29\\) which gives a remainder of \\(1\\) when divided by \\(4\\), which gives a decimal part of \\(0.25\\). Repeat this process for the rest of the terms in both \\(2023\\) and \\(2025\\).</p>
        <p>The decimal parts you should end up with, for both equations, should be \\(0.5\\), \\(0.25\\), \\(0.625\\), and \\(0.625\\). Adding there all together gives us \\(1\\) meaning that all the values are integers.

        answer: "\\(B) 3\\)",
        solution: `<b>3</b><p>First start by finding the prime factorization of \\(60\\). Doing this should yield</p>
        $$
        2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5
        $$
        <p>To find the number of factors, we take each exponent that each prime factor is raised to and add 1, giving us \\(3\\), \\(2\\) and \\(2\\) and multiply them together to find a total of \\(12\\) prime factors.</p>
        <p> Now returning to the question. It states that the final sum must be positive, but nothing about the actual numbers. We know that in order for the product to be positive, the factors must either be all positive or have two that are negative and one positive. Since we want the lowest possible 
        sum, the latter is a better option</p>
        <p>The one positive factor must be the largest because it needs to be greater than the absolute value of the sum of the two other terms in order for the final sum to be positive. We also want the absolute value of the sum of the two negative factors to be as close to the reamining factor
        because we want the sum to be as small as possible. Another thing that the question carefully neglects to address is that there is no limitation on using the number 1, this will come in handy because when maximizing the sum of factors, it helps if they are further away from each other.</p>
        <p>With this in mind, it helps to start from the middle. When we're dealing with factors, this doesn't mean dividing by 2, but finding the square, or the nearest thing. \\(\\sqrt{60}\\) is irrational, but we know that it must be near \\(8\\) because we know that \\(\\sqrt{64}\\) is equal to \\(8\\). Using this, we can find that the
        nearest integer factors to the square root are \\(6\\) and \\(10\\). Now, obviously \\(10\\) has to be the positive number, so we have to break down \\(6\\), right? Nope, recall that we can maximize the sum of two factors by making them further apart, and that we want the absolute value of the negative sum to be as large as possible without being greater than 10. Using this knowledge,
        we can make the \\(3\\) factors \\(-1\\), \\(-6\\), and \\(10\\) with a sum of \\(3\\).</p>

        We recognize that \\(m^2+mn+n^2=(m+n)^2-mn\\). By adding \\(mn\\) to both sides of the orginal equation, we can use that fact I just addressed to factor out one side:

        Since we're dealing with integers, we know that \\((m+n)^2\\) is a perfect square. This means that we need a perfect square that is a sum of two consecutive numbers, particularly factors of the square. Using inductive reasoning, we know that this isn't possible UNLESS the square is \\(0\\). This is only possible when \\(m=-n\\). Furthermore, we know that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) have to be \\(\\pm 1\\)  in order for the right side of the equation to equal \\(0\\).

        <p>We now have \\(3\\) answers left. The next step may require you to draw out a graph, but intuition should be fine. We can set \\(f(300)\\) and \\(f(900)\\) to some arbitrary value \\(a\\), which is the same for both. We want the difference between \\(f(800)\\) and \\(f(400)\\) to be as large as possible. We notice that both are
        exactly \\(100\\) away from the input for \\(a\\). Since we want the greatest difference, we want one to be greater than \\(a\\) and one to be smaller. We also want the change from \\(a\\) to \\(f(800/400)\\) to be as large as possible, so we use the largest possible slope, which we know is \\(\\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\). Since the difference is \\(100\\) between \\(300\\) and \\(400\\), we can say the output goes down by
        \\(50\\) and the same for the other two, making the maximum distance \\(100\\). Now, we input that into our equation \\(|f(f(800))-f(f(400))| \\le \\frac{1}{2}|f(800)-f(400)|\\) so we know that the final answer is \\(50\\).</p>

        the equation above. Then, you substitute \\(2^17\\) back for \\(x\\) and find that the sum is a string of powers of \\(8\\) powers of \\(2\\), plus the starting \\(0\\), for \\(17 \\cdot 8 +1=137)</p>
