<h3>Powers of \\(2\\)</h3>
<p>For \\(2^{n\\textup{th}}\\) power, look at the \\(10^{n\\textup{th}}\\) digits. So if dividing by \\(2\\), the last digit needs to be divisible by \\(2\\). If dividing by \\(4\\), the last \\(2\\). If dividing by \\(8\\), the last \\(3\\), and so on</p>
<h3>Powers of \\(3\\)</h3>
<p>If you take the sum of the digits of a number and it is divisible by some power of \\(3\\), then that number is divisible by \\(3\\). </p>
<h3>5's and 10's</h3>
<p>Pretty self explanatory. If it ends in \\(5\\) or \\(0\\) it is divislbe by \\(5\\). If it ends in \\(0\\) it is divisible by \\(10\\). For higher powers of \\(10\\), the number needs to end in as many trailing zeroes as are in the power of \\(10\\)</p>
<h3>7</h3>\
<p>Take the last digit and multiply by \\(2\\)</p>
<p>Subtract double the last digit (what we calculated before) from the remaining digits</p>
<p>If the answer is a multiple of \\(7\\), then it is divisible. If you're not sure, keep goin</p>
