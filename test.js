        start by writting and equation and defining your variables. For this, we can have

        <p>We know that Andy has been traveling for \\(h+1\\) hours. We also know that speed is equal to distance over  time, or that distance is equal to speed times time. Knowing this, we can set up equations for the distance they have both traveled:

        solution: `<b>A) 595 </b><p>Let's start by simplyfying this as much as possible. \\(1183\\) simplifies down into \\(13\\sqrt{7}\\).</p>
        <p> Knowing this, we can simplify \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) into \\(a\\sqrt{7}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{y}\\) into \\(b\\sqrt{7}\\) where \\(a+b=13).</p>
        <p> To elminate the square roots, we square both sides so that our new equation is</p>
        $$
        7a^2+7b^2=1183
        $$
        $$
        7(a^2+b^2)=1183
        a^2+b^2 = 169
        $$
        <p> We can use our knowledge of factoring and the quadratic formula to derive that \\(a^2+b^2=(a+b)^2-2ab\\). This is because we know that \\((a+b)^2\\) is equal to \\(a^2+2ab+b^2\\) since it is a common formula found in quadratics. Removing \\(2ab\\) gets our original equation.</p>
        <p> Since \\(a^2+b^2\\) should be as small as possible in order for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be as small as possible, and we already know that a+b = 13, the expression ends up </p>
        $$
        169-2ab
        $$
        <p> We want \\(ab\\) to be as large as possible for \\(a^2+b^2\\) to be as small as possible. We can set up the AM-GM inequality:</p>
        $$
        \\frac{a+b}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{ab}
        $$
        <p>Since \\(a+b=13\\), and we want \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to be integers, we need to get \\(\\sqrt{ab}\\) as close to \\(\\frac{13}{2}\\) as possible. We can square both sides and find \\(ab \\ le \\frac{169}{4}\\), or \\(ab \\le 42.25\\). Since 42 is a product of \\(6\\) and \\(7\\) (iykyk), we know that those are the best values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), because they also fit into all our other parameters.,

A target \\(T\\) is the region where \\((x^2+y^2-25)^2 \\le 49\\). A dart is thrown and lands at a random point in \\(B\\). The probability that the dart lands in \\(T\\) can be expressed as \\(frac{m}{n} \\cdot \\pi \\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers. What is \\(m+n\\)?
        `,
        type: "mc",
        choices: ["\\(A) 39\\)", "\\(B) 71\\)", "\\(C) 73\\)", "\\(D) 75\\)", "\\(E) 135\\)"],
        answer: "\\(B) 71\\)",
        solution: `<b>71</b> <p>The first step is to visualize the graph. If you are particularly knowledgeable about different types of graphs and functions, you may know that \\(|x|+|y| \\le 8\\) maps out a diamond-like shape. However, let's go through through why this is true: </p>
        <p>Consider the definition of absolute value   functions, and the root absolute value function. It is pretty common knowledge that \\(y=|x|\\) looks sort of like a V. This is because absolute value, by definition, makes everything positive. When looking at the equation \\(|x|+|y|\\) we know that there are four different situations, \\(2\\) where \\(x\\) is positive and \\(2\\) where \\(x\\) is negative, with the same being true for y. Thus, this means that 4 potential linear graphs are created, which are bounded and converge to make a diamond. We know that the "vertices" are at every point on an axis that has an absolute value of \\(8\\), since that is the y/x intercept.</p>
        <p>To find the probability that the dart lands in the target, excluding human error (you probably won't have to worry about this in a math competition), we just find the area of the target and divide it by the area of the square. First, let's find the area of the square.
        <p>Use the pythagorean theorem to find the side lengths of the square </p>
        $$
        \\sqrt{8^2+8^2}
        $$
        $$
        <p>Since the area of a square is just the side length squared, we know that the area of the square is \\(128\\).

        <p>Notice that this is squared. The most important thing about squares is that it makes everything positive. Since \\(49\\) is a perfect square, we can take that as a hint to take the square root of the equation. This gives us
        $$
        |x^2+y^2-25| \\le 7
        $$
        <p>We use absolute value because the value can be equal to \\(\\pm 7\\)</p>
        <p>We can rewrite this equation into a compound inequality:</p>
        $$
        -7 \\le x^2+y^2-25 \\le 7
        $$
        $$
        18 \\le x^2+y^2 \\le 32
        $$
        <p>Returning to the formula of a circle, \\(x^2+y^2=r^2\\). If we treat the less than equal to as an equal sign, we can see that the area bounded is between two circles of radiuses \\(\\sqrt{18}) and \\(\\sqrt{32})
        $$
        <p>The target is bounded between these circles, so we just need to find the area of the larger circle and subtract the area of the smaller cirlce. Obviously, the larger circle has a radius \\(sqrt{32}\\)</p>
        $$
        \\sqrt{32}^2\\pi
        $$
        <p>which is \\(32\\pi\\)</p>
        <p>Now find the smaller circle (gonna skip the math because it's self-explanatory) which should be \\(18\\pi\\).</p>
        <p>Subtracting gives a target of area \\(14\\pi\\)</p>
        <p>This means the probability of hitting the target is \\(\\frac{14\\pi}{128}\\), which simplifies into \\(\\frac{7\\pi}{64}\\) making \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) \\(7\\) and \\(64\\), respectively. Add these to get a sum of \\(71\\).</p>

        <p>A) all the terms being added are integers</p>
        <p>B) the non-integer terms sum to an integer</p>
        <p>\\(P(2022)\\) and \\(P(2024)\\) must be integers they are divisble by \\(2\\). Even if they weren't divislbe by larger powers of \\(2\\), the equation conveniently raises these numbers to specific powers in order to change it into a number that is divisble by \\(4\\), \\(8\\), etc. </p>
        <p>Now lets look at the remaining numbers, \\(2023\\) and \\(2025\\). Neither of these numbers are divisble by \\(2\\), so they will produce a decimal part for all terms of this equation. That being said, if those decimal parts can sum to an integer, than the sum will still be an integer.</p>
        <p>For both \\(2023\\) and \\(2025\\), we know that the remainder when divided by \\(2\\) will be \\(0.5\\). Recalling the divisibility rules for powers of \\(2\\), we know that when a number is divided by \\(2\\) to the  \\(n\\)th power, if the last \\(n\\) digits are divisible by \\(2\\) to the \\(n\\)th power, so is the original number.</p>
        <p>Since we want to save time, instead of calculating \\(2023^2\\), we calculate \\(23^2\\) and find the last two digits, since we know they will be the same in both cases. This ends up being \\(529\\), with the last two digits being \\(29\\) which gives a remainder of \\(1\\) when divided by \\(4\\), which gives a decimal part of \\(0.25\\).

        <p>The decimal parts you should end up with, for both equations, should be \\(0.5\\), \\(0.25\\), \\(0.625\\), and \\(0.625\\). Adding there all together gives us \\(1\\) meaning that all the values are integers.

        $$
        2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5
        $$
        <p>To find the number of factors, we take each exponent that each prime factor is raised to and add 1, giving us \\(3\\), \\(2\\) and \\(2\\) and multiply them together to find a total of \\(12\\) prime factors.</p>
        <p> Now returning to the question. It states that the final sum must be positive, but nothing about the actual numbers. We know that in order for the product to be positive, the factors must either be all positive or have two that are negative and one positive. Since we want the lowest possible 
        sum, the latter is a better option</p>
        <p>The one positive factor must be the largest because it needs to be greater than the absolute value of the sum of the two other terms in order for the final sum to be positive. We also want the absolute value of the sum of the two negative factors to be as close to the reamining factor
        because we want the sum to be as small as possible. Another thing that the question carefully neglects to address is that there is no limitation on using the number 1, this will come in handy because when maximizing the sum of factors, it helps if they are further away from each other.</p>
        <p>With this in mind, it helps to start from the middle. When we're dealing with factors, this doesn't mean dividing by 2, but finding the square, or the nearest thing. \\(\\sqrt{60}\\) is irrational, but we know that it must be near \\(8\\) because we know that \\(\\sqrt{64}\\) is equal to \\(8\\). Using this, we can find that the
        nearest integer factors to the square root are \\(6\\) and \\(10\\). Now, obviously \\(10\\) has to be the positive number, so we have to break down \\(6\\), right? Nope, recall that we can maximize the sum of two factors by making them further apart, and that we want the absolute value of the negative sum to be as large as possible without being greater than 10. Using this knowledge,
        we can make the \\(3\\) factors \\(-1\\), \\(-6\\), and \\(10\\) with a sum of \\(3\\).</p>

        <p>Here's where it gets a little bit complicated, because you do have to have an extent of knowledge of pythagorean triples. That being I said, I <b>highly</b> recommend studying common pythagorean tripelets beforehand. Knowing this, we can use the 
        knowledge that \\(7, 24, 25\\) is a pythagorean tripelet. So with that in mind...does that make the answer \\(1\\)? No. Recall that squaring a number gives the same as squaring the negative of that number, so \\(-24\\) is also a value for \\(n\\). So is that it? \\(2\\)?. Not exactly, there's still a few solutions left.
        We know thta the square root of \\(0\\) is \\(0\\). With this knowledge, we can set \\(m\\) to \\(0\\) and solve for \\(n\\) which gives two different values, \\(7\\) and \\(-7\\). With that, we have <b>4</b> values for \\((m,n)\\).

        solution: `<b>23</b><p>Saying that \\(P(x)\\) has a remainder of \\(x+2\\) when divided by \\(x^2+x+1\\) is to say that multiplying \\(x^2+x+1\\) by some value \\(K\\) (not nescessarily a constant) and adding \\(x+2\\) gets \\(P(x)\\). We can write this as <p>

        <p>We start by dividng \\(|x_{1}-x_{2}|\\) on both sides, giving us</p>
        $$
        \\frac{|f(x_{1})-f(x_{2})|}{|x_{1}-x_{2}|} \\le \\frac{1}{2}
        $$
        <p>Recall that \\(f(x)\\) is effectively a fancy way of saying \\(y\\), or the output of an input in the graph. Looking at our equation, we see that what we're really looking at is a slope formula, where the change in the output, \\(f(x)\\)  is divided by the input, \\(x\\).</p>
        <p>This is important, because it tells us that at any given point, the absolute value of the slope of \\(f(x)\\) CANNOT be more than \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)</p>
        <p>Let's now focus on what we're actually trying to solve for. In \\(f(f(800))-f(f(400))\\), \\(f(800)\\) and \\(f(400)\\) are the inputs. That means that</p>
        $$
        \\frac{|f(f(800))-f(f(400)|}{|f(800)-f(400)|} \\le \\frac{1}{2}
        $$
        <p>Just imagine we're taking the slope of the graph of \\(f(f(x))\\) (or the double derivative)</p>
        <p>We multiply \\(|f(800)-f(400)|\\) on either side, which gives us the equation</p>
        $$
        |f(f(800))-f(f(400)| \\le \\frac{1}{2}|f(800)-f(400)|

        <p>We substitute that into \\(|f(f(800))-f(f(400)| \\le \\frac{1}{2}|f(800)-f(400)|\\)  to get \\(|f(f(800))-f(f(400)| \\le  100\\), eliminating two answer choices. </p>
        <p>We now have \\(3\\) answers left. The next step may require you to draw out a graph, but intuition should be fine. We can set \\(f(300)\\) and \\(f(900)\\) to some arbitrary value \\(a\\), which is the same for both. We want the difference between \\(f(800)\\) and \\(f(400)\\) to be as large as possible. We notice that both are
        exactly \\(100\\) away from the input for \\(a\\). Since we want the greatest difference, we want one to be greater than \\(a\\) and one to be smaller. We also want the change from \\(a\\) to \\(f(800/400)\\) to be as large as possible, so we use the largest possible slope, which we know is \\(\\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\). Since the difference is \\(100\\) between \\(300\\) and \\(400\\), we can say the output goes down by
        \\(50\\) and the same for the other two, making the maximum distance \\(100\\). Now, we input that into our equation \\(|f(f(800))-f(f(400))| \\le \\frac{1}{2}|f(800)-f(400)|\\) so we know that the final answer is \\(50\\).</p>

        solution: `<b>\\(32\\pi\\)</b><p>The key tip of this problem is to make everything as simple as possible. We have virtually no constraints for the size of the smaller semicircle.

The smaller the circle gets, the closer \\(\\overline{CD}\\) or \\(16\\) gets to the diameter. Thus, if we ignore the existence of the semicircle, the diameter becomes 16.

        solution: `<b>0.75</b><p>Since we're only dealing with ratios, we can make the dimension of the larger square whatever we want. If this weren't abour ratios, I would recommend using a variable. However, since the values don't really matter here, we can just use 1, which will make our math the easiest. The areas of the squares are then 1, \\(k^2\\) (since the side lengths are multiplied by k, and then multiplied by each other). Effectively from here on out, the area is \\(k\\) raised to the power of the-xth-largest-square-times-two. Since we know that the shading alternates, and we are solving for the shaded area, we can alternate between adding and subtracting these.</p>

        Since we know that the area of the first square is 1, we don't have to divide: this is our common ratio, or \\(\\frac{64}{100}\\). Using this, we can solve for \\(k\\)</p>

        answer: "\\(A) 12\\)",
        solution: `<b>12</b><p>Let's start by setting a few clear rules nad guidelines, then we'll procede to use casework:</p>
        <p>First, we know that two reflections over the same axis will return \\(T\\) to the original position. This can't happen, because that would mean we only have on turn left, which would take it back off the origin</p>
        <p>The same can be said about two rotations of \\(180^\\circ\\).</p>
        <p>If we use ONLY rotations, we know that the sum of the angles of the rotations must be some multiple of \\(360\\). This can only occur in \\(2\\) ways (discounting order), being \\(90, 90, 180\\) and \\(270, 270, 180\\). We can confirm this
        with some modular arithmetic, but I won't get into that. Since two of the tranformations are the same, there are only \\(3\\) ways to order them, so there are \\(6\\) ways to get \\(T\\) back to the ORIGIN using ONLY rotations.</p>
        <p>Next, let's consider a situation where we use \\(1\\) reflection</p>
        <p>Some quick casework shows that this is impossible, since you can't isolate and get the one variable that you make negative back to being positive without switching them and switching back, which would then get the other variable negative.</p>
        <p>Now, we use \\(2\\) transformations. We've already proved that they can't be of the same type, so we have one reflection over the \\(x\\) axis and one over the \\(y\\) axis. This leaves us with \\((-x,-y)\\), which we can get back to \\((x,y)\\) by a rotation of 
        \\(180^\\circ\\). With \\(3\\) distinct transformations, we can order it in \\(3!=6\\) ways. Thus, there are \\(6+6=12\\) solutions.`,

        text: `Inside a right circular cone with base radius \\(5\\) and height \\(12\\) are three congruent spheres with radius \\(r\\). Each sphere is tangent to the other two spheres and also tangent to the
        bae and side of the cone. What is \\(r\\)?`,
        solution: `<b>\\(\\frac{90=40\\sqrt{3}}{11}\\)</b><p>First start by drawing two diagrams. The first is half a vertical cross-section of the cone. We would draw a right triangle with legs \\(5\\) and \\(12\\) and hypotenuse(by pythagorean theorem\\) \\(13\\). We then draw a circle of radius \\(r\\) tangent to the bottom 
        leg and to the hypotenuse. We note that it is NOT tangent to the longer leg, because in order for that to be true, all \\(3\\) spheres would have to touch the middle of the cone, which isn't possible</p>
        <p>The next is a circle that is essentially the bottom cross-section. A circle of radius \\(5\\) with three circles inside. Note that these circles aren't tangent to the large circle, because then they would have to be tangent to the edge of the cone, where the pointy bit and the base meet, which obviously is not possible.</p>
        <p>Like a good deal of diagrams on the AMC 10, these weren't nescessarily nescessary for the problem itself, but conceptualizing it, at least to me, makes it infinitely easier.</p>
        <p>Returning back to the second drawing, let's draw lines between the centers of all the small circles, the ones with radius \\(r\\). This yields an equilateral triangle. We know that the center of the circle of radius \\(5\\) is also the circumcenter, incenter, and centroid of the triangle.</p>
        <p>Let's focus in on that last one, centroid. A centroid is the intersection of all medians and divides the medians into two parts witha \\(2:1\\) ratio. Let's focus on the vertical centroid, or at least the one that appears vertical. If you don't have one of these in our drawing, you can always rotate it. We know that the length of this median is \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) because \\(1^2+b^2=2^2\\) (pythagorean theorem), so
        the sides on opposite sides of the centroid have lengths of \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\), respectively. Hold on to this, we'll come back later.</p>
        <p>Let's return back to our first drawing. We know that there is some distance between the circle and the center of the cone. We don't exactly know what that is, because we don't know the radius of the circle. We do, however, from our last diagram, know the distance between the 
        center of that circle and the center of the larger circle: \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).</p>
        <p>We can also draw a radius from the center of the circle to the center of the cone. This divides the height of the cone into \\(12-r\\) and \\(r\\), since the bottom bit has the lenght of the radius. If we draw a line from the top of the cone to the center of the circle, that forms a right triangle with legs of, guess what, \\(12-r\\) and \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\). The hypotenuse, in addition to being
        the sum of those two squared, is ALSO the hypotenuse of a triangle formed by drawing a radius from the center to the point where the circle is tangent to the cone. This has a leg of \\(r\\), the radius and \\(13-(5-\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}=8+\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\), which we derive  because the remaining length of the base, on the opposite side of the center of the sphere, is the same length as the remaining part of the \\(13\\) hypotenuse, by power of a 
        point.</p>
        <p>Set the two equations equal to eachother and solve:</p>
        $$
        r^2+(8+\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3})=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}^2+(12-r)^2
        $$
        $$

    solution: `<b>147</b><p>By drawing lines fron the...indented..? parts of each point, we can see that the figure is divided into \\(11\\) kite-shaped figures. Now, dividing these in half by drawing a line from the 
    protruding point/vertex to the center, we have \\(24\\) triangles to deal with. Looking at these, my first instinct was to find the altitiude where the base is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{6^2+6^2}}{2}=3\\sqrt{2}\\). We know this because the side lengths of the squares is \\(6\\), and we find the whole diagonal length and then divide by \\(2\\). </p>
    <p>At this point, I got stuck trying to find the altitude, although I'm not enitrely sure it's impossible and will try to look at it again</p>
    <p>We can notice, however, that since the angle  at the furthermost vertex is \\(90\\) degrees, we can make a square by extending the lines adjacent to that vertex and meeting them with perpendicular lines frm the origin. This creates a square. If we use the equation \\((3\\sqrt{2})^2=2x^2\\), we know that the side lengths are equal to \\(3\\). We know that the right triangles on the sides of the
    square, the ones that we created by creating the square, are \\(30-60-90\\), because we rotated each sheet by \\(30^\\circ\\). Thus, to find the top edge of the right triangle, we just find \\(3\\cdot \\tan(30)=\\sqrt{3}\\).

        and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers. What is \\(m+n\\?)`,
        solution: `<b>67</b><p>Draw a square that inscribes the square of side length \\(1\\) and cuts the isoceles triangle between the large square, the small square, and the rectangle with defined points into two parts. We
        know that this triangle is isoceles because it has two side lengths of \\(1\\).</p>
        <p>This creates \\(6\\) congruent triangles by \\(AAS\\). We can label the legs of the triangle \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) for short and long, respectively.</p>
        <p>We also see a congruent triangle bounded in the right bottom corner by the larger rectangle. We can label that too.</p>
        <p>We also know that, by \\(AA\\), the triangle with hypotenuse \\(3\\) in the bottom left corner is similar to these with a ratio of \\(1:3\\) (since the hypotenuse of the congruent ones is \\(1\\) and the hypotenuse of the bigger one is \\(3\\)). We can then label
        accordingly, so the legs are \\(3a\\) and \\(3b\\). Since the larger shape, the one that contains all of these, is a square, we know the side lengths must be equal, so \\(a+b+b+3a=3b+a\\) or\\(3a=b\\). Rename every instance of \\(b\\) with this, for simplicity.</p>
        <p>We can find the exact value of \\(a\\) using the pythagorean theorem beacause \\(a^2+9a^2=1\\), which means \\(10a^2=1\\) and thus \\(a=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}\\).</p>
        <p>By drawing a horizontal line through the intersection of \\(R\\) and the oter rectangle to the side of the larger square, we can create another right triangle. We know that this triangle is similar to the \\(6\\) or \\(7\\) congruent triangles. We can
        call the side lengths of these \\(x\\) and \\(3x\\). The side length of a the large square is \\(10a\\). We know that the triangle formed between the square we drew and rectangle \\(R\\) are congruent by \\(AAS\\). Thus, we can call one side of the triangle \\(3a\\) and another \\(3x\\) (because it is the same as the one we mentioned before)</p>
        <p>Since we know that the side lengths sum to \\(10a\\), we can label the remaining sides as \\(6a-3x\\) and \\(4a-x\\). By \\(AA\\), the triangle that those lengths form is similar to the one below it, with side lengths \\(3a\\) and \\(3x\\).</p>
        <p>We set up te ratio \\(\\frac{3x}{3x}=\\frac{6a-3x}{4a-x}\\), which we can multiply out to be \\(12a^2-3ax=18ax-9x\\) which we can divide by \\(3\\) into \\(4a^2-ax-3x^2\\) and factor into \\((4a-3x)(a-x)\\).</p>
        <p>We have two solutions for where \\(a=c\\) and \\(a=\\frac{3}{4}\\). We try both of these situations seperately</p>
        <p>Calculating from here gets messy. However, we can solve for the possible side lengths using \\(a=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10}}\\) in both cases to find areas of \\(\\frac{9}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\) for \\(\\frac{m}{n}=\\frac{52}{15}\\) and \\(m+n=67\\)</p>
        <p>Side note, if you wanted to not assign variables and just calculate, you can also use the pythagorean theorem and find that \\(a=\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10}\\) and do the rest of the calculations from there. This ibt is extraneous, but if you like using numbers more than ratios, it may help

        <p>If we were to draw lines from the centers of the two preexisting circles to the center of the "3rd circle", the one we draw between them, it also forms a right triangle with the same hypotenuse and legs \\(1+r\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}+r).

There are \\(4\\) ways for them to be diagonal (2 in each orientation and then flipping the values), and for each of those \\(4\\), the values of \\(p, s\\) can
        be reversed, so there are \\(8\\) total there.</p>
        <p>If we have all of one kind, obviously there are just \\(4\\). </p>
        <p>If we have \\(2\\) kinds, it has to be ones that don't have restrictions against each other. For each group of \\(2\\), there are \\(4\\) choose \\(2\\) =  \\(6\\) ways. We can have \\(cs, cp, ws, wp\\) for a total of \\(6 \\cdot 4=24\\)</p>
        <p>Let's say we have \\(3\\) of one crop and \\(1\\) of another. Same process as before, there are \\(4\\) combinations for the types of crops, but then we double this because the order matters and then we do \\(4\\) choose \\(3\\) for \\(16\\). We double this, however, because we can switch which is \\(3\\) and which is \\(1\\)</p>
        <p>Finally, if we have a \\(2\\), \\(1\\), \\(1\\) situation. Effectively, a pair that cannot share a border, and then the other two are diagonal. There are \\(2\\) for the ones that must be diagonal, and then \\(2\\) ways to choose the \\(2\\) of a kind crop. There's \\(4\\) combinations. There are \\(2\\) ways to orient the diagonals and another \\(2\\) for switching the
