        <p>The numerator for \\(n > 1\\) is always going to be \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\). The denominator is always going to be \\(\\frac{n+1}{n}\\) because when we add by \\(1\\) and change the one so that we can add it to the fraction, it adds \\(n\\) to the numerator.

between \\(1\\) and \\(999\\) inclusive does \\(f(f(n))=8\\)?`,
solution: `<b>111</b><p>First start by finding what \\(f(n)\\) must be. We know that the highest sum \\(f(n)\\) is \\(9+9+9=27\\), so we're looking for numbers whose sum of digits is \\(8\\) that are \\(leq 27\\). This gives us \\(26, 17, 8\\).</p>
<p>Let's calculate all of these individually. For \\(26\\), we need two \\(9\\)s and one \\(8\\). There is no other way to do it because it is a large number. We can put the \\(3\\) in \\(3\\) places, so there are \\(3\\) options.</p>
<p>Next is \\(17\\). For the following two, I want to use a method called stars and bars, which is a systematic equation that discounts overcounting. The full proof can be found online, but all you need to know is that when dividing "stars" into bins separated by "bars". The formula is \\(\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}\\) where \\(n\\) is the number of stars and \\(k\\) is the number of 
bins (\\(k-1\\) would be the number of bars). When dividing \\(17\\), we can imagine we have literally \\(17\\) stars divided into \\(3\\) sections, the digits. For this we do \\(\\binom{17+2}{2}=\\frac{19!}{2!(17!)=\\frac{19 \\cdot 18}{2}=19 \\cdot 9 = 171\\). We do need to be careful though, because there are chances that we put more than \\(9\\) in one "bin" which we cannot do because no digits place can have more than \\(9\\). To account for this overcounting, 
we find the number of ways where we overcount. This happens when one value is at least \\(10\\) so the remaining \\(7\\) are distributed among \\(3\\) bins (because it can also go in the bin where the \\(10\\) is) so we have \\(\\binom{7+2}{2}=\\frac{9!}{7!(2!)}=36\\). Since the one that is over can be in \\(3\\) places, we multiply that by \\(13\\). Thus, for \\(17\\) there are \\(171-36(3)=63\\)</p>
<p>The last one is \\(8\\). We do stars and bars for \\(8\\) across \\(3\\) which is \\(\\binom{8+2}{2}=\\frac{10!}{8!(2!)}=45\\).</p>
<p>Thus, we have \\(3+63+45=111\\)`,
